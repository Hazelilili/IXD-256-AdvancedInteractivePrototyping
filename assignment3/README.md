### Part II
#### Project Description
This project, as a part of the Rube Goldberg Machine, mainly consists of a simple transmission structure driven by a servo and a digital input (the built-in button of the Atom S3 Lite). I assembled a small axle using Lego blocks, and used hot glue to fix one end of it to the servo and the other end above the bendable area of a cut-out cardboard with a meme attached. As the servo moves clockwise and counterclockwise, it completes a "bowing" action.

However, since I used a 360-degree rotating servo, the angle couldn't be controlled as precisely as I had envisioned. So, I used a bit of a "tricky" method, adjusting the timing to control the servo's rotation process to achieve a specific angle for the bowing action.
