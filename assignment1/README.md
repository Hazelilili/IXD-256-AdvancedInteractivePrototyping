### Part II
#### Project Description
I have decided to go with the second idea, "glove controller." My initial concept is to use this project as the hardware interaction part of a UI/UX project. It would involve controlling specific items or on-screen content through finger interactions. For example, using finger taps to switch drawing tools or possibly incorporating angle sensors or pressure sensors in future assignments to adjust certain attributes  (e.g., thickness, size, texture) of on-screen contents (e.g., lines, material spheres, objects). I haven't fully developed the entire project yet, but the current task is to first implement the finger interactions.
#### Interactive Behavior 01
Except for the thumb, each of the other four fingers has a corresponding RGB light. Whenever the thumb touches one of the fingers, the corresponding RGB light will be turned on. Even if the two fingers separate, the RGB light will remain on. The RGB light that is currently on will turn off only when the thumb touches another finger, and the RGB light corresponding to the newly touched finger will be turned on. If the thumb touches multiple fingers, all RGB lights will be turned off.
